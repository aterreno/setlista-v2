# Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

This document contains the architectural decisions made for the Setlista project.

## ADR-001: Frontend Technology Stack

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-12-31  
**Deciders:** Development Team  

### Context
We needed to choose a frontend technology stack for building a web application that allows users to search for artists, view setlists, and create Spotify playlists.

### Decision
We chose **React with TypeScript** as our frontend technology stack.

### Rationale
- **React**: Mature ecosystem, excellent component reusability, large community support
- **TypeScript**: Better development experience with type safety, improved maintainability, better IDE support
- **Create React App**: Quick setup and sensible defaults for React applications
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing aligned with React best practices

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Type safety reduces runtime errors, excellent developer experience, strong ecosystem
- **Negative**: Additional compilation step, learning curve for TypeScript

## ADR-002: Backend Architecture Pattern

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-12-31  
**Deciders:** Development Team  

### Context
We needed to design a scalable backend architecture that integrates with multiple external APIs (Setlist.fm, Spotify) while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

### Decision
We adopted **Clean Architecture** with the following layers:
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests/responses
- **Domain Services**: Business logic implementation
- **Domain Repositories**: Interface definitions for data access
- **Infrastructure**: External API implementations and data persistence

### Rationale
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between business logic and external dependencies
- **Testability**: Easy to mock dependencies and test business logic in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Changes to external APIs don't affect business logic
- **Scalability**: Can easily swap implementations without affecting core logic

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Highly testable, maintainable, and scalable architecture
- **Negative**: More complex folder structure, additional abstraction layers

## ADR-003: Runtime Platform and Framework

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-12-31  
**Deciders:** Development Team  

### Context
We needed to choose a runtime platform and web framework for our backend services.

### Decision
We chose **Node.js with Express.js** and **TypeScript**.

### Rationale
- **Node.js**: JavaScript ecosystem consistency with frontend, excellent performance for I/O operations
- **Express.js**: Minimal, flexible web framework with large ecosystem
- **TypeScript**: Type safety, better development experience, easier refactoring
- **Async/Await**: Clean handling of asynchronous operations (API calls)

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Consistent language across stack, excellent async handling, rich ecosystem
- **Negative**: Single-threaded nature requires careful handling of CPU-intensive tasks

## ADR-004: Cloud Infrastructure and Deployment

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-12-31  
**Deciders:** Development Team  

### Context
We needed to choose a cloud platform and deployment strategy for a web application with varying traffic patterns.

### Decision
We chose **AWS with serverless architecture** using:
- **AWS Lambda**: Backend API hosting
- **Amazon CloudFront**: CDN for frontend assets
- **Amazon S3**: Static website hosting for React app
- **AWS API Gateway**: API routing and management
- **AWS CDK**: Infrastructure as Code

### Rationale
- **Serverless**: Pay-per-use pricing, automatic scaling, reduced operational overhead
- **AWS CDK**: Type-safe infrastructure definitions, better than raw CloudFormation
- **CloudFront**: Global CDN for improved performance and HTTPS termination
- **API Gateway**: Built-in throttling, monitoring, and request/response transformation

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Cost-effective for variable traffic, automatic scaling, reduced maintenance
- **Negative**: Vendor lock-in, cold start latencies, debugging complexity

## ADR-005: Testing Strategy

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-12-31  
**Deciders:** Development Team  

### Context
We needed to establish a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure code quality and reliability.

### Decision
We implemented a multi-layered testing approach:
- **Unit Tests**: Jest for backend services and utilities
- **Component Tests**: React Testing Library for frontend components
- **Integration Tests**: Testing API endpoints with mocked external services
- **Coverage Requirements**: 80% test coverage target with pre-commit enforcement

### Rationale
- **Jest**: Excellent TypeScript support, built-in mocking, snapshot testing
- **React Testing Library**: Testing based on user interactions rather than implementation details
- **Mocking Strategy**: Mock external APIs to ensure test reliability and speed
- **Coverage Enforcement**: Prevents regression and ensures new code is tested

### Consequences
- **Positive**: High confidence in code changes, faster debugging, documentation through tests
- **Negative**: Additional development time, maintenance of test suites

## ADR-006: CI/CD and Quality Assurance

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-12-31  
**Deciders:** Development Team  

### Context
We needed to establish automated quality gates and deployment processes to maintain code quality and streamline releases.

### Decision
We implemented the following quality assurance pipeline:
- **Husky**: Git hooks for pre-commit quality checks
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing and deployment on push/PR
- **ESLint**: Code linting for consistent style and error prevention
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run tests, coverage, and linting before allowing commits

### Rationale
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Catch issues early, prevent broken code from entering repository
- **GitHub Actions**: Free for public repositories, integrated with GitHub, excellent ecosystem
- **ESLint**: Industry standard for JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- **Automated Deployment**: Reduces human error, faster release cycles

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Consistent code quality, automated deployment, early issue detection
- **Negative**: Slower commit process, potential developer friction with strict quality gates

## ADR-007: External API Integration Strategy

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-12-31  
**Deciders:** Development Team  

### Context
We needed to integrate with two external APIs (Setlist.fm and Spotify) reliably, handling rate limits and network issues.

### Decision
We implemented the following integration patterns:
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract external API calls behind interfaces
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed requests (3 retries, 1-second base delay)
- **Timeout Configuration**: 30-second timeouts for all HTTP requests
- **Batch Processing**: Process Spotify playlist creation in batches of 5 songs with delays

### Rationale
- **Repository Pattern**: Enables easy testing and potential API provider switching
- **Retry Logic**: Handles temporary network issues and API hiccups gracefully
- **Timeouts**: Prevents hanging requests from blocking the application
- **Batch Processing**: Respects API rate limits and prevents overwhelming services

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Robust handling of external service issues, testable API integration
- **Negative**: Increased complexity in error handling, longer processing times for large playlists

## ADR-008: State Management and Data Flow

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-12-31  
**Deciders:** Development Team  

### Context
We needed to manage application state and data flow between components in the React frontend.

### Decision
We chose **React built-in state management** with:
- **useState**: Component-level state management
- **Custom Hooks**: Shared logic (useAuth, useDebounce)
- **Props**: Data flow between components
- **API Service Layer**: Centralized API calls

### Rationale
- **Simplicity**: Application state complexity doesn't justify external state management
- **React Built-ins**: Reduces bundle size, leverages React's optimizations
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic without additional dependencies
- **Service Layer**: Centralized API logic, easy to test and maintain

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Smaller bundle size, leverages React optimizations, easier to understand
- **Negative**: May need refactoring if state complexity grows significantly
